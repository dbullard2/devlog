        <p class="body">tl;dr: even the old devlog, as simple as it is, needs to be
        tweaked and upgraded. for now i've fixed the scrollbar situation (hopefully),
        have added tags so you can search the devlog by project or technology,
        and have added search bar functionality so it works that way too.</p>
