    <h1>The Beginning</h1>

    <p>This is the beginning of the process that'll hopefully end with me
    getting a job in the web development industry. The first of the five projects
    that I plan on putting in my portfolio to showcase my skills before I start
    sending it around and trying to get a job in the industry. But enough about
    my life plans, let's get onto the devlog.</p>

    <p>Over the past few days, I've started development on a site called Tests
    (definitely not going to be the final name but it's the best I could think of
    for now). The purpose of the site is to allow it's users to create and share
    multiple choice tests, and view people's answers and scores. In order to access
    and take another user's test, a unique 6 digit alphanumeric test ID is needed.
    As you can see below, the generation of the ID client-side and the sending
    of the ID to the firebase database is something I have alreday implemented.
    This is my first time with sending data to a server somewhere so it was a bit
    confusing, but with the help of Stack Overflow and a few YouTube tutorials, I
    was able to work things out.</p>

    <p>And what you see above is pretty much the entirety of the site right now.
    I still need to get the design language fleshed out, work on making the site
    responsive, and work on the layout of this page and some of the other pages I'm
    planning, but I'd say this is a pretty good start.</p>
