    <h1>Upgrades</h1>
    <p>So you know that tl;dr I wrote with all of the stuff I planned on implementing
    for the devlog? Turns out it's going to be a lot harder than I thought to implement
    and I have no idea how to do it. So for now, I've added the hashtags in, but they
    don't do anything, I've been looking at ways to hide the scrollbars but nothing
    I can find on stack overflow is working so I'll have to keep trying, and the search
    bar is still there but I can't work out how to find a word on a page let alone multiple
    pages. That could be because I'm trying to use javascript when I should be using
    something else like python. I still have a long way to go.</p>
