    <h1>Let's Keep It Virtual</h1>

    <p>w<span style="color: #ffc2f6;">ai</span>fu is a cutting edge virtual girl
    designed to steal your heart. At least, she would be if she were real. This
    is just a funny idea for a landing page that I had. So far, it's been sort of
    difficult trying to come up with things to put on the page. I've got this Section:</p>
    <img src="../media/Screenshot_2019-11-21 waifu.png" alt="">
    <p>and that's pretty much where things died because this isn't actually a real
    product. I've also got this review section with a few reviews that I made up:</p>
    <img src="../media/Screenshot_2019-11-21 waifu (1).png" alt="">
    <p>which is the only other thing on the site right now. I'm not happy
    with how the review section looks so I'll have to change it later, but right
    now I'm focused on adding content to flesh the site out more. The current plan
    is to talk more about what it is, how it works, faq, a section that allows
    you to customise a waifu, and of course a footer at the bottom. That should
    bulk up the site quite a bit, and end up as a nice final product.</p>
