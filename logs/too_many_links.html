    <h1>Too many links</h1>

    <p>People always say to create projects that you'd use yourself. This is pretty
    much the first time I'm trying it out, and so far it's been great advice. Most of the time
    it's hard for me to keep motivated on longer, more complicated projects
    (which is why tests has sort of been put on the back burner), but on this
    project, it's been easy for me to keep pushing because I actually want to
    use it when it's finished. That's pretty much all from me, now let's get to the devlog.</p>
    <img src="../media/Screenshot_2019-11-22 Bookmarks.png" alt="">
    <p>So Bookmarks! It's a simple bookmark manager that I made so i could keep
    my bookmarks and pinned tabs organised aross devices. So far, I just spent a lot
    of time trying to figure out how to create a new &lt;p&gt; element, allow the user to
    edit it, and have it save. My first idea was to have a bunch of &lt;p&gt;s hidden
    and a bunch of text inputs hidden and stacked on top of each other. The input would
    show up when the user added a new  bookmark folder, and I would take what they typed
    and set the &lt;p&gt; equal to that value and hide the input. This fell apart when I couldn't
    figure out how to position the &lt;p&gt; and &lt;input&gt; on top of each other (which I
    ironically figured out by accident later on while working on something completely unrelated).</p>
    <p>Eventually, after a lot of trial and error (and a fair bit of googling) I stumbled upon
    two things: the contenteditable attribute and the insertAdjacentHTML() method. These two things
    are what I'm currently using to allow users to add bookmark folders. When the new folder button
    is clicked, I use this jacvascript function to create a new folder:</p>
    <div class="code">
      <pre><span class="purple">function</span> <span class="blue">addFolder</span>(){
        <span class="red">document</span>.<span class="blue">getElementById</span>(<span class="green">'one'</span>).<span class="blue">insertAdjacentHTML</span>(<span class="green">'afterend'</span>, newFolder);
        localStorage.<span class="red">headerHTML</span> <span class="blue">=</span> header.<span class="red">innerHTML</span>;
}</pre>
    </div>
    <p>The first line gets the one untitled folder theat is on the sidebar on the left by default
    and, when the new folder button is pressed, inserts a new untitled contenteditable folder underneath
    it. The folder name the user enters saves whenever they click anywhere on the page.</p>

    <p>And that is pretty much all of the backend I've done so far. The only other JS I've done is
    make the background and add new bookmark button a random (from an array) colour whenever the page loads.
    And on the front end, I've done what you can see in the screenshot. And that's what I've done so far.
    Most of the core functionality is there, but there's still a bunch of stuff I want to add. I need to add
    the ability to remove bookmark folders once you add them, search functionality, make things responsive,
    and scrape some images, etc from bookmarked sited to make things look better. So stay tuned!</p>
